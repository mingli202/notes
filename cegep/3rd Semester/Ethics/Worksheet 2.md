# Section 2

- White fragility

         Behavior among white people characterized a repulsion to racial issues involving them to regain their racial comfort. This is caused by their lack of knowledge about racism due to their environment being white dominant.

- Segregation

        Because of the white dominance, whiteness is seen as the ideal color. As such, ideals about white superiority implicitly circulate all around us, shaping our perspectives to segregate society in favour of the dominant group.

- Good/Bad binary

        Racism is well known to be socially bad. People who are racist are bad, and those that aren't are good. Thus, this shifts the focus of racial analysis to individuals rather than the whole racial group.

- Individualism

        In the white culture, individualism is a core concept. Therefore, white people see themselves as individuals, so when confronted about racial issues, they simply say that they are different from the others and that they have no part in white dominance.

- Psychic freedom

        Concept that revolves around the fact that white people do not have to worry about racial issues. Since they are the dominant group, they are the ones in favor of this system. They naturally don't seek to change it. As such, those that are oppressed are the ones who have to worry about such issues, it is up to them to bring it up if they are unhappy about something in society. This gives white people more psychological energy for other issues.

# Section 3

1. Even if all white people understood white fragility and decided to reach for humility, would they still change this system that has been beneficial to themselves to one that would be less? Why? (question for the white racial group as a whole)

2. If you, as a white person, knew that changing the way society works will most likely negatively affect your life, as in the amount of privileges you have, will you take actions to change it? Why? (question for a member of the white racial group)

3. I don't get how erasing white fragility will make society any better because our society will still be mostly white.
