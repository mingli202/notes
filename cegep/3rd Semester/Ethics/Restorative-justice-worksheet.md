# Section 2

- Restorative Justice: Instead of punishing the criminal for their crime, restorative justice aims to repair the damages caused by the criminal.

- Inclusion: Inclusion seeks the full participation of all parties. By being more included in the process, the victims can be more informed about the rights and services they might expect, as well as the status of their case.

- Encountering: Restorative justice emphasizes the encounter between the offender and the victim. It can lead to a meaningful discussion about stories from both parties as they get to know each other more. Emotions can play an important part in this discussion.

- Responsibility: Restorative justice aims for the repair of the harm caused by the offender. These repairs should be done by the person who made the harm. The offender taking responsibility for his harm can be beneficial in the healing of the victim.

- Reintegration: After committing harm, the offender is often alienated from society since they are feared. Likewise, the victims may isolate themselves in fear of the same thing happening to them again. Reintegration aims to bring them back into the community for their well-being.
