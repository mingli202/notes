**HE'LL Always Be the Greatest** Greenberg, Jay

- Wayne Gretzky first met Gordie Howe at a sports awards banquet in 1972.
- He told him to work on his backhand
- "Gretzky's momentous shot not only broke Howe's record but also tied the game 4-4. He then won the game for the Kings in overtime with still another goal, and he did all this against his old teammates, in the city where he led the Oilers to four Standley Cups before being traded to Los Angeles last year. And he did it on 780 games to Howe's 1767." (68)
- "There is not end to Wayne's brilliance," Howe would say after the game. (69)
- "Well, if Gretzky has taken up the misguided notion that a 61-year-old man can still be competitive with elite athletes in their 20s, he should be indulged. His clouded thinking is the result of almost 25 years of acute hero worship." (69)
- "It was Howe, after all, who rescued the 11-year-old Gretzky when the hockey prodigy was suffering from stage fright at that banquet in Brantford, Ont." (69)
- "It was also Howe who a few years later told the adolescent Gretzky that he had two eyes and one mouth and that the best advice he could give him was to keep the two open and the one closed." (69)
- "And it was Howe who, in that '79 series against the Russian club, told Gretzky to get the opening face-off back to Mark Howe and then go for the net." (69)
- "In the first WHA game he ever played against Howe, he stole the puck from his idol. Gretzky was wheeling back up ice, feeling very much like a legend-to-be, when he suddenly felt a sharp whack on his thumb. When he looked up, the old coot--always known for the crafty use of his stick--was winking at him." (70)
- "Howe was equally gracious. 'I kissed that record goodbye a long time ago, when Wayne started getting 200 points a year,' said Howe. 'He's good, and I know because I played with him. If you want to tell me he's the greatest player of all time, I have no argument at all.'" (70)
- "And yet, Howe established the record--he became the NHL's career scoring leader in 1960 when he passed Maurice Richard's total of 965 points--with the patience and concentration of an architect." (70)
- "Last week the energy and the sheer joy of playing that passed from Howe to Gretzky when he was just a kid were returned as Gretzky unselfishly turned this record for the ages into a celebration of Howe." (71)

**Waiting for Wayne: Gretzky's journey draws to and end; Waiting for Wayne: Gretzky 80% sure his career is over (National Edition): [Toronto Edition]** Cole, Cam

- "For nearly 10 years, he made all the right moves in Edmonton -- the 50 goals in 39 games, the 92-goal season and four years later, 215 points, and most important, four Standley Cups -- all by the age of 27." (Cole A3)

**Wayne's New World** Deacon, James and Susan McClelland

- After retiring, Gretzky has become something of an idol and is paid to give talk. Basically he is sponsored.
- Attract the mass and gain popularity with his name and fame.
- For example: Chief executive of TransAlta, Stephen Snyder, paid high six figures for Gretzky to be the spokesman of an important announcement concerning the provincial electrical utility.
- "Snyder is still smiling later that evening when, over at company headquarters, Gretzky is the main attraction at a TransAlta reception for the province's political and business elite." (Deacon 62)
- "He has played celebrity golf tournaments from Nevada to Pennsylvania, and promoted a summit on the state of Canadian hockey." (64)
- "He has lent his name and memorabilia to a slew of fund-raisers, and his presence to his dad's event in support of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind in hometown Brantford, Ont." (62)
- "Somewhere along the line, he took the family to Hawaii and opened an exhibit at the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto." (62)
- "Though his California-based agent, Micheal Barnett, and the powerful marketing arm of the International Management Group, Gretzky has announced six new endorsement deals, bringing to 10 the number of companies for whom he acts as a spokesman." (62)
- "He is also adding to his portfolio of licensing agreements for the use of his name and image, and equity positions." (62)
- "There's Wayne selling tires one minute, painkillers the next, breakfast cereal after that, and the glut of TV and print exposure has prompted some newspaper columnists to suggest that byy exercising his marketing muscle, Gretzky has tarnished his own well-polished image." (62)
- "Gretzky's popularity is such that hall officials in Toronto figure they could fill SkyDome for the occasion."
- Although stung by criticism about his endorsements, he is forging ahead in business, expanding his sponsorship portfolio and taking ownership positions in some new companies that exchange a percentage of their businesses for the use of his enormous public appeal." (62)"
- "No wonder he is looking for something else to do. Like golf. He played a lot in the weeks immediately following his final game, 36 holes on many days." (62)
- "He does have the touch for endorsing. His first-ever deal, for Titan hockey sticks in 1979, boosted the little-known Finnish company to become the biggest stick manufacturer in the world." (62)
- "Through his playing career, he represented car rental firms and consumer electronics and soft drinks--while with Los Angeles in the early 1990s, he counted 17 companies in his bulging portfolio and an off-ice income that, in some years, outstripped the $8.5 million (U.S) annual salary he collected form the Kings." (62)
- "When marketing managers open their companies' wallets for the Great One, they are buying his popularity, his performance record, his name, and most of all, his remarkable ability to attract media attention." (62)
