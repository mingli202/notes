Fast forward to Sunday, Oct. 15, 1989. Gretzky takes the puck on that backhand and flips it into the net with 53 seconds left in the Kings' game with the Oilers at Edmonton's Northlands Coliseum. In that instant the NHL career-scoring record of 1,850 points that Howe built over 26 seasons was surpassed.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Gretzky had tied the record with an assist early in the game, but as time ticked away in the third period, it appeared that the mark would not be broken this night in this place, with its strong ties to Gretzky. Then, suddenly, there was that Howe-recommended backhand, which Gretzky had practiced at home with a tennis ball only a zillion times or so.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Gretzky's momentous shot not only broke Howe's record but also tied the game 4-4. He then won the game for the Kings in overtime with still another goal, and he did all this against his old teammates, in the city where he led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups before being traded to Los Angeles last year. And he did it in 780 games to Howe's 1,767.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"There is no end to Wayne's brilliance," Howe would say after the game. Howe had been traveling with Los Angeles for about a week, at the invitation of Kings owner Bruce McNall. Though he claimed to have no inside word as to when the record breaker might come, Howe did drop a hint in Vancouver that he might be in the know. He showed up for L.A.'s game against the Canucks--two days before the record-breaking game in Edmonton--in a turquoise sport coat. "If I thought he was going to do it tonight, I would have worn a suit," Howe said. "The suit will be on in Edmonton."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">That wasn't the first time during the week that a future Howe wardrobe had become an object of speculation. Five nights earlier he had suggested to the media that he might put on a uniform again after New Year's, at age 61, to fulfill a desire to play NHL hockey in each of six decades.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Los Angeles papers noted the frivolous nature of Howe's comments about unretiring, but a Detroit paper took them seriously. Suddenly, Howe became interested. "The general public evidently is excited," he said, "and it does make you feel good." On Oct. 11, Howe's wife, Colleen, had a statement read to the press in which she downplayed this "fantasy," but then she added to the confusion by going to the podium and saying, "If he's going to get in shape for one game, he might as well play a season."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Gretzky, who began his professional career in 1978 with the Indianapolis Racers of the WHA and thus got to play three games alongside Howe on an All-Star team in a '79 series against Dynamo Moscow, said he thought a Howe comeback was a great idea. "If Gordie wants to play, I'm sure he can," said Gretzky.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Well, if Gretzky has taken up the misguided notion that a 61-year-old man can still be competitive with elite athletes in their 20s, he should be indulged. His clouded thinking is the result of almost 25 years of acute hero worship.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It was Howe, after all, who rescued the 11-year-old Gretzky when the hockey prodigy was suffering from stage fright at that banquet in Brantford, Ont. Howe had jumped up, put his arm around Gretzky and announced, "When someone has done what this kid has done in the rink, he doesn't have to say anything." What the kid had done that year was score 378 goals in 82 games for the sub-peewee-level Brantford Nadrofsky Steelers.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It was also Howe who a few years later told the adolescent Gretzky that he had two eyes and one mouth and that the best advice he could give him was to keep the two open and the one closed. And it was Howe who, in that '79 series against the Russian club, told Gretzky to get the opening face-off back to Mark Howe and then go to the net. Mark would throw it into the corner, where Gordie would retrieve it and get it to Gretzky in front of the goal. In 10 seconds the puck was there for an easy tap-in.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">And there was another lesson Gretzky would always remember. In the first WHA game he ever played against Howe, he stole the puck from his idol. Gretzky was wheeling back up ice, feeling very much like a legend-to-be, when he suddenly felt a sharp whack on his thumb. When he looked up, the old coot--always known for the crafty use of his stick--was winking at him.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">GRETZKY NEVER SAW A RECORD HE DIDN'T WANT, but he wishes somebody else had owned this one. He insists that Howe will always be the greatest. Uneasy at the thought of diminishing a legend, Gretzky told Howe months ago it would mean a lot to him if Howe could be there when--gee, Gordie, sorry--the inevitable occurred.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Howe was equally gracious. "I kissed that record goodbye a long time ago, when Wayne started getting 200 points a year," said Howe. "He's good, and I know because I played with him. If you want to tell me he's the greatest player of all time, I have no argument at all."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Like its holder, Howe's record had been built to last. He dominated the corners--and didn't cut many either on the way to scoring his 1,850 points. All but the last five of his 26 NHL seasons were played in a fiercely competitive six-team league, where defenders gave up few easy goals.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mr. Hockey had the arms of a lumberjack, and the callous disregard of one, too, for any limbs that might get in the way of his work. And yet Howe established the record--he became the NHL's career scoring leader in 1960 when he passed Maurice Richard's total of 965 points--with the patience and concentration of an architect. "He was in control of the whole game," says Gretzky, who watched Howe on TV in his prime. "He seemed to do everything so gracefully."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Howe averaged 30 goals and 40 assists a year for those 26 seasons. He never scored 50 goals, but only in his first three seasons and his final one did he score fewer than 20. He played a full decade before slap shots became common and almost another 10 years after that before defensemen started to join the attack. Only in the last four NHL seasons before his first retirement were there expansion teams such as the Oakland/California Golden Seals to pile up goals on, making 100-point seasons possible. Howe didn't have one of those until 1968-69, the second season after the league doubled in size. He was 41 years old then, good as always, but more remarkable than ever.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"I don't care how far past his record I go, he'll always be the greatest player who ever lived," says Gretzky. "And the classiest too. See, one of the great things about him is that he doesn't get into comparing eras. You'll never get him to say that the competition now is watered down.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"It bothers me, sure, when I hear that. Obviously, the game is not as defensively oriented as it was in his day. The defensemen almost never came up past the blue line. Offensive players were never used to kill penalties. But you won't get Gordie to say now that the game used to be better. Because it wasn't. I can see how it has improved just from when I came into the league. I'd see a 6' 3" defenseman then, and I figured I could have a field day because he couldn't move. Now they're that size but mobile and smart. The skill level is higher now than it was 20 years ago, and 20 years from now it'll be higher than it is now."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Last week the energy and the sheer joy of playing that passed from Howe to Gretzky when he was just a kid were returned as Gretzky unselfishly turned this record for the ages into a celebration of Howe. "Thank God Wayne is the person he is," said Colleen, "because he is bigger than the league. He is what hockey is today."</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">From SPORTS ILLUSTRATED, October 23, 1989</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Gretzky unselfishly turned this record for the ages into a CELEBRATION OF HOWE.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Mutual admiration has long bonded Howe and Gretzky, here at a 1999 All-Star practice.</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The Howe-Gretzky link, which began when Wayne was 11, was strengthened when they celebrated point 1,851 (left), in 1989. In '94, goal 802 (bottom) broke another Howe record.</p><p>~~~~~~~~</p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">By JAY GREENBERG</p><div><hr width="25%" noshade="noshade" /><span class="medium-normal">© 2012 ABG-SI LLC.
