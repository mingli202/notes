# Viruses

- consists of coat protein (capsid) and nucleic acids
- made up of protein and genetic material -> cell makes protein and dies
- virus cannot reproduce by itself and cannot use energy
- virus particle must infect another cell and have its nucleic acid material converted to protein by infected cell
  - Target includes animals, plants, fungi, protists, prokaryotes.
- viral nucleic acid results producing more virus
- as virus particles accumulate and cell runs out of resources, viral particles are eventually released, leaving a dead and burst cell.

types of virus:

1. virus invades cell but tell the cell that it just chills and the cell ignores it -> keeps the viral DNA alive. until the outbreak, when the cell mass produces the virus all at once. the virus can wait for the immune system to stop paying attention to them. HIV waits for you to be sick and mounts an army to destroy yor immune system.

the cell receives the viral DNA/RNA, then makes protein encoded by the virus genetic material.
the cell make so much viral protein that they burst open, or if they survive they die for neglecting their own need.

pros of virus with cell membrane:

- can't be mistaken as a normal cell and pass under the radar of immune system.

cons:

- soap destroys the cell membrane -> disassembles the bilayer.
