# Oral Presentation:

Subject: Use parameters to constrain sketch geometry

1.  What is a parameter?

        Basically variables.
        Everything sketch/object has their own parameters.

2.  How to access them.

        solid > Modify > parameters

3.  Using them.

        Show how to use param to constrain sketch geo
        > param > user param > sketch > use param

        Show how you can change the parameters of an object.
        Show that it will also change the object.

4.  Show example how to use parameters (complex examples).

        Constrain to a range of values:

        min({maxValue}; max({minValue}, {userValue}))

        show that it works
