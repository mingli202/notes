~ Line spacing: x1.1-1.3 font size for headings, x1.3-1.5 for body.
~ Letter spacing (depending on the font): (-1%, -2%) for heading.
~ For anything that spans more than 3 lines, go for text left instead of center.
~ Body text: 50 to 75 characters, or about 600px on desktop.
~ Try to stick with 2 font sizes, and use font weights and subtle color changes to indicate hierarchy.
~ For white spaces, consider the relationships. More related elements are closer.
