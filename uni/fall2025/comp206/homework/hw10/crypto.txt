The three pillars of information security are confidentiality, integrity, and availability (the CIA triad):
- Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized parties.
- Integrity ensures that information remains accurate, complete, and unaltered unless modified by authorized means.
- Availability ensures that information and systems are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users.

Attack analysis:
- The ransomware attack on hospital patient records primarily undermines availability, as it prevents legitimate access to critical data until payment is made.
- The data theft attack on the payment processor's database primarily undermines confidentiality, as it exposes sensitive information to unauthorized parties.

Diffie-Hellman key exchange:
Two parties use Diffie-Hellman to establish a shared secret key over an insecure public channel without having pre-shared secrets. This is useful when:
- The parties have no prior secure way to exchange keys (e.g., first-time communication)
- They need forward secrecy (compromise of long-term keys doesn't reveal past session keys)
- They want to avoid the overhead of physically delivering keys (common in internet protocols like TLS/SSL)
The algorithm allows each party to combine their own private key with the other's public value to independently compute the same shared secret, while eavesdroppers cannot derive it.

RSA proof of private key ownership:
RSA can prove private key ownership through digital signatures. The owner creates a signature by encrypting a message hash with their private key. Anyone can verify this by decrypting it with the corresponding public key and comparing it to a freshly computed hash of the message. Successful verification proves that:
- The message originated from the private key holder (authentication)
- The message wasn't tampered with (integrity)
- The signer cannot later deny signing it (non-repudiation)

Preshared key authentication (HMAC):
With preshared key K, you can attach a Message Authentication Code (MAC) using HMAC (Hash-based MAC):
1. Compute HMAC(K, message) = H(K ⊕ opad || H(K ⊕ ipad || message))
	- Where H is a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256)
	- opad and ipad are padding constants
2. Append this MAC to the plaintext message
3. I recompute the HMAC using my copy of K and the received message
4. If my computed MAC matches yours, I verify you authored it and it wasn't altered
This provides authentication and integrity without encryption, as the message remains readable while the MAC ensures its origin and detects any tampering.
