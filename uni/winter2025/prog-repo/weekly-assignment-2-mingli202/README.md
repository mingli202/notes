# Weekly Assignment 2

## Deliverables

### Your Task

1. **Complete the TODOs**: 
   - Implement all methods marked with `TODO` in the three Java files under `src/tut02Exercises`. Refer to the tutorial slides for detailed descriptions of the required functionality.

2. **Test Your Code**:
   - Run the provided tests in `src/Main.java` to check your implementations. 
   - Add more test cases to ensure correctness and handle edge cases.

3. **Commit and Push**:
   - Commit only the Java files (`*.java`) you modify. Do not commit unrelated files.

### Submission Requirements

- Submit all completed Java files (`*.java` extension only).
- Ensure your code adheres to the problem descriptions in the tutorial slides.

## Instructions for Completion

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Use the `git clone <url>` command to clone the repository to your local machine. This will create a directory named `weekly-assignment-2-*` (with * being your GitHub username).

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment**:
   - Open the cloned folder in your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).

3. **Implement the Methods**:
   - Edit the methods marked with `TODO` in the Java files under `src/tut02Exercises`.

4. **Test Your Code**:
   - Run `src/Main.java` to check the provided tests. Write additional tests as needed.

5. **Push Your Changes**:
   - Use the following commands to commit and push your changes:
     ```bash
     git add src/*
     git commit -m 'Completed weekly assignment 2'
     git push
     ```

## How Java Packages Work

In Java, a **package** is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces. Think of it as a folder in your file system. Packages help in avoiding name conflicts and allow for better modularization of code.

### Structure of a Package
In this assignment:
- The folder `tut02Exercises` under `src` represents the `tut02Exercises` package.
- Each Java file inside this folder belongs to the `tut02Exercises` package.

For example, the first line of each Java file in this folder should be:
```java
package tut02Exercises;
