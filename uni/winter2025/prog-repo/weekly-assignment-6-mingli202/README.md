# Weekly Assignment 6

## Deliverables

- Complete methods marked with `TODO` in the Java files located in `src/data_structures/SSinglyLinkedList.java` and `src/data_structures/SDoublyLinkedList.java`. Detailed descriptions of each method are provided in the tutorial slides.
- Both the `SSinglyLinkedList` and `SDoublyLinkedList` classes implement an interface called `SList`. Interfaces will be covered in lectures very soon, and are not needed for this assignment, so do not worry about them for this lecture.
- Both linked-list data structures also utilize generics (shown as `<E>`). Understanding of generics is also not crucial for this assignment, and will also be covered in detail in the future lectures.
- Please do only commit all Java files (those that end with a `.java` extension).

## Instructions
1. Similar to the previous assignment, we will once again start by cloning this repository onto your local machine by using the `git clone <url>` command (detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)). If done properly, observe that a folder with the following naming pattern `weekly-assignment-6-*` (with * being your GitHub username) will be created.
2. Import project into your IDE of choice. For example, this can be performed by opening the cloned folder (with the naming pattern `weekly-assignment-6-*`) within Intellij.
3. Complete all methods marked with `TODO` (see above). 
4. Once you are satisfied with your code, perform the following git operations:
```bash
git add *
git commit -m 'adding completed code'
git push
``` 
*Please check your private repository for the assignment on GitHub to see if your code was submitted correctly -- what you see there is what will be graded.*
