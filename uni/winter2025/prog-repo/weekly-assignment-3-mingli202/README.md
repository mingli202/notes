# Weekly Assignment 3

## Deliverables

- Complete the methods marked with `TODO` in the two Java files located in `src/week03exercises`. Detailed descriptions of each method are provided in the tutorial slides.
- Some simple tests are provided in `src/Main.java`, where you can run them to check for correctness. These tests may not be comprehensive; additional tests may be released later in the week.
- Please only commit all Java files (those that end with a `.java` extension).

## Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Start by cloning this repository onto your local machine using ssh. Detailed instructions for cloning repositories can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
   - If done properly, observe that a folder with the following naming pattern `weekly-assignment-3-*` (where `*` is your GitHub username) will be created.

2. **Open the Project in IntelliJ**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA.
   - Select **File > Open...** from the menu.
   - Navigate to the cloned folder (with the naming pattern `weekly-assignment-3-*`) and select it.
   - Click **Open**.

3. **Set Up the Project**:
     - Under **Project Settings > Modules**, ensure that the `src` folder is marked as a **Sources Root** (it should appear in blue). If it is not, right-click on the `src` folder in the Project Explorer and select **Mark Directory as > Sources Root**.

4. **Run the Tests**:
   - Open `src/Main.java` in IntelliJ.
   - Right-click anywhere inside the file and select **Run 'Main.main()'** to execute the tests provided.

   **Note:** Avoid directly double-clicking `Main.java` in your file explorer. This will open the file in a text editor, and IntelliJ will not correctly recognize the source directory, leading to issues when trying to run the file.

5. **Complete the TODOs**:
   - Locate and complete all methods marked with `TODO` in the Java files found in `src/week03exercises`.

6. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Once you are satisfied with your code, perform the following git operations in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git add *
     git commit -m 'adding completed code'
     git push
     ```
   - Check your private repository for the assignment on GitHub to verify that your code was submitted correctly. Remember, what you see there is what will be graded.
