# Weekly Assignment 8

## Deliverables

- Complete methods marked with `TODO` in the Java files. This includes:
    - `E remove(i)` in `src/data_structures/SArrayList.java`,
    - `add(i, e)` in `src/data_structures/SSinglyLinkedList.java` and `src/data_structures/SDoublyLinkedList.java`
    - `push(e)`, `E pop()` and `E peek()` in `src/data_structures/SListStack.java` 
    - `enqueue(e)`, `E dequeue()` and `E peek()` in `src/data_structures/SListQueue.java`
    - `resize()` and `E dequeue()` method in `src/data_structures/SCircularQueue.java`
- `Main.java` contains a couple of test cases to help check if the implementations are correct. You are not expected to change anything in `Main.java`.
- Please do only commit all Java files (those that end with a `.java` extension).

## Instructions
1. Similar to the previous assignments, we will once again start by cloning this repository onto your local machine by using the `git clone <url>` command (detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)). If done properly, observe that a folder with the following naming pattern `weekly-assignment-8-*` (with * being your GitHub username) will be created.
2. Import project into your IDE of choice. For example, this can be performed by opening the cloned folder (with the naming pattern `weekly-assignment-8-*`) within Intellij.
3. Complete all methods marked with `TODO` (see above). 
4. Once you are satisfied with your code, perform the following git operations:
```bash
git add *
git commit -m 'adding completed code'
git push
``` 
*Please check your private repository for the assignment on GitHub to see if your code was submitted correctly -- what you see there is what will be graded.*
