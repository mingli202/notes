# Weekly Assignment 10

## Deliverables
- Complete `placeAndDivide` method in `QuickSort.java` and `numOccursKTimes` method in `NumOccurrencesChecker.java`. 
- `Main.java` contains a couple of test cases to help check if the implementations are correct. You are not expected to change `Main.java` file.
- Please do only commit all Java files (those that end with a `.java` extension).

## Instructions
1. Similar to the previous assignments, we will once again start by cloning this repository onto your local machine by using the `git clone <url>` command (detailed instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)). If done properly, observe that a folder with the following naming pattern `weekly-assignment-10-*` (with * being your GitHub username) will be created.
2. Import project into your IDE of choice. For example, this can be performed by opening the cloned folder (with the naming pattern `weekly-assignment-10-*`) within Intellij.
3. Complete all methods marked with `TODO` (see above). 
4. Once you are satisfied with your code, perform the following git operations:
```bash
git add *
git commit -m 'adding completed code'
git push
``` 
*Please check your private repository for the assignment on GitHub to see if your code was submitted correctly -- what you see there is what will be graded.*
